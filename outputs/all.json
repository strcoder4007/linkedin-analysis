          "content": "This is a masterclass you don’t want to miss. \n\nWatching Roger Federer speak to university students made me sit up and wonder—can we admire and respect him even more than we already do? \n\nHis words took me back to every master I’ve ever seen in action—whether on screen, in an office, or on the sports field. \n\nFederer, one of the greatest athletes of all time, didn’t just play tennis—he created magic with a racquet in hand. But through his speech, he reminds us that what seemed like magic was actually the product of relentless dedication and an unshakable work ethic. \n\nPeople thought he barely broke a sweat. Yet behind what the world saw as effortless genius was a man who spent countless hours practicing, strategizing, and failing. \n\nThat effortlessness? It’s a myth. \n\nMuch like Virat Kohli’s cover drive or Rohit Sharma’s pull shot. We assume it's pure talent, but in reality, they’ve practiced those shots a million times. \n\nThe same applies to fitness. There’s no magic formula. It’s years—decades—of clean eating, disciplined training, and consistent effort. \n\nIt never gets easier. You just get better. \n\nWhether we’re entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists, the lesson is clear—true mastery is not about ease but about persistence. \n\nThe ease you see is hard-earned. \n\n\"It's only a point,\" Federer said. In tennis, just like in life, not every serve goes our way. What matters is what we do next. \n\nDo you dwell on the missed shot, or do you prepare for the next one? \n\nDespite his global fame and near-mythical status, Federer speaks about life’s richness beyond the court. There’s something deeply humbling in how he calls himself a father first, cherishing simple joys like driving his kids to school. \n\nHis speech was more than just a pep talk for students. It was a masterclass in resilience, discipline, and perspective—the very principles that built one of the greatest sporting legacies. \n\nEverything he said is a guide to winning at life. With grace. With excellence. 🤩",

Semiotics is the study of how signs and symbols create and communicate meaning.\n\nA small example from everyday life: at my local supermarket, every price tag is black text on a yellow background. In semiotics, black and yellow together often mean warning, caution, or urgency: think hazard signs, bees, wasps, and certain snakes. In retail, that same color combination often signals discounts or special offers. So when you see it, you instinctively think bargain.\n\nBut here’s the trick; when every price tag uses that color scheme, it creates the illusion that everything is on sale, even when it’s not. Check the receipt, and the illusion disappears. A subtle, clever piece of retail psychology.\n\nSemiotics helps us ask not just what something means, but:\n• Where did this meaning come from?\n• Why is it being used here?\n• What reaction was it meant to provoke?\n• What does it remind people of?\n\nIt’s a way of tracing cultural cues back to their origins, understanding how they’ve found their way into our everyday perceptions.\n\nGrateful to Dr Rachel Lawes and Panos Dimitropoulos for opening my eyes to the ways semiotics shapes retail, shopping, and even the clever tricks that have us buying things we never planned to.\n\n\nhashtag\n#Semiotics \nhashtag\n#RetailStrategy \nhashtag\n#ConsumerPsychology \nhashtag\n#BrandStrategy \nhashtag\n#ShopperInsights \nhashtag\n#MarketingPsychology",

From leading strategic hiring to being part of a company driven by integrity and innovation.\n\nI am now excited to begin a new chapter as Director Talent Acquisition at DAMAC Group.\n\nWith over four decades of redefining luxury, from iconic towers and master planned communities to global collaborations in fashion and lifestyle, DAMAC blends scale with vision.\n\nFuelled by a vibrant induction, I got a real sense of DAMAC legacy, ambition and purpose. I saw how community impact is embedded in the company DNA. I also had the chance to visit DAMAC Hills 1, Cavalli Villas, Trump Golf Course and Paramount Hotel, a glimpse into the scale, creativity and vision that drive it all. Overall, I feel welcomed.\n\nAs DAMAC accelerates across real estate, data centers, hospitality, retail and tech driven ventures, I am energised by the opportunity to help shape the leadership and talent that will drive its next chapter.\n\nwww.damacgroup.com",

Every project depends on tracking material, labor, and equipment price trends. That is where construction cost indices come in. They provide real-time insights, helping developers budget smarter and avoid surprises.\n\nInstead of guessing, they can predict. Fewer cost overruns, better negotiations, and transparency.\n\nCost indices ensure fair escalation clauses and cost transparency, offering flexibility in a fluctuating market. But they need careful management to avoid discrepancies. In short, cost indices turn curiosity into clarity—and clarity into control.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gSTabrGM\n\n\nhashtag\n#contractmanagement \nhashtag\n#costindices \nhashtag\n#Construction",

Count how many photos you see of the breakfast buffet, the spa lobby, or a latte with perfectly dusted cocoa art. Now count how many pictures you find of the gym.\n\nExactly.\n\nAs someone who has spent over 20 years in this industry, opening hotels, rebranding them, building their reputations, and creating content pretty much 24/7, I still find myself baffled by this particular blind spot. We spend fortunes on treadmills, wellness consultants, Technogym equipment, even scented towels. And then… we don’t show it?\n\nI just got back from my staycation and yes, I was reminded, again, of what I wanted to rant about.\n\nHere’s the thing. I’m not a fitness influencer. But I am a hotel guest. And when I book my stay, I look at three things in this order:\n 1. Location\n 2. Wellness facilities (yes, the gym matters)\n 3. Room size and vibe\n\nAnd I’m not alone. Wellness is no longer a trend-it’s a lifestyle, and for many, a non negotiable. Guests want to know what they’re walking into. Yet most hotel content skips the gym entirely. We’ll see 25 angles of a croissant and 14 shots of an empty ballroom before we see a single decent image of the fitness space if we see one at all.\n\nFrom a content and commercial standpoint, this is a missed opportunity. And dare I say, a revenue leak. Because I know I’ve skipped so many bookings due to the lack of gym visibility. And I know others who have, too.\n\nIt doesn’t take much. A quick reel of someone mid workout, a carousel showing off your recovery zone, even a highlight tour of the space. Bonus points if you actually tell us who it’s for: jet lagged execs, spin addicts, gym rats, or just parents escaping the breakfast buffet chaos.\n\nWe’ve spent years reimagining hospitality around experiences, lifestyle, and personalization. And yet, in 2025, the gym is still treated like an afterthought. Maybe it’s time we moved it closer to the front.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, that same old croissant isn’t booking the room. But a gym that makes me want to train? That just might.\n\nWe want to work out every day. Just like we want to eat. Sleep. Breathe. \n\nSo please, show us the gym.",

          "content": "There are moments as a parent that just hit differently, and watching my 11-year-old daughter recently embark on her very first entrepreneurial adventure was definitely one of those proud moments worth sharing. Seeing her navigate the process – from ideation to execution – filled me with an overwhelming sense of pride and immense hope for the next generation of leaders.\n\nAs a woman leader in marketing, I've always championed innovation and strategic thinking, and believed in the power of initiative. To see those seeds blossom in my own girl at such a young age, and to witness her enthusiasm and learning, is truly rewarding and inspiring at the same time.\n\nWhat started as a passion project for beaded jewelry at home, led her to exhibit at a community market last year. This was followed by an incredible offer to collaborate for a limited edition collection by a woman-led (thanks a mil Eisha Ramrakhiani! ❤️) home-grown online jewelry brand - E3K, earlier this year.\nIn case you're in the mood for some retail therapy, you can find a link to her collection that just dropped - E3K x Jannat here: [https://e3k.shop/]\n\nDid it add work for us as parents? Yes, of course! But given both our marketing backgrounds, we made her understand that brands are not built overnight, and you need to be committed to the cause. From picking the name of her brand, to designing the logo, deciding the platforms to be present on, and crafting her brand story – she was part of it all and led with heart.\nThe best part was showing her how to run a business or shall I say 'show me the money'! Thankfully, she was quick to grasp that it doesn’t all go back into the piggy bank. Instead, the '3 F’s' of budgeting would apply to how she manages her income:\n- Fundamentals\n- Fun\n- Future self\n\nIt's a powerful reminder that the lessons we learn, and the opportunities we create, can truly shape incredible futures. Feeling extremely grateful and inspired today.\n\n(Jai Tolani) \n\n\nhashtag\n#SmallWins \nhashtag\n#Entrepreneurship\n\nhashtag\n#NextGenLeaders\n\nhashtag\n#ProudMom \nhashtag\n#WomenInBusiness\n\nhashtag\n#WomenInMarketing\n\nhashtag\n#FamilyAndCareer",

Neither waited for the “right” moment.\n\nThey just played their game when it mattered.\n\nReminds me why I sometimes make my best calls at work when I stop overthinking and just go with what feels right.\n\nSome of our biggest wins have come from trusting ourselves rather than waiting for perfect data.\n\nAnyway, hell of a match.

          "content": "A German psychologist spent years memorizing nonsense syllables.\n\n\nHis self-experiment in 1885 revealed something shocking about human memory.\n\nThe results explain why most training programs fail - and how to fix them:\n\nThe experiment: Hermann Ebbinghaus tested his own memory using meaningless combinations of letters.\n\nHe memorized lists, then tested himself at different intervals. What he discovered changed our understanding of learning forever. \n\nThe brutal truth: Within an hour of learning new information people tend to forget up to 50% of it. Within 24 hours, this can increase to 70% .\n\nWithin a week, they forget up to 90% of what they \"learned\". Your brain literally dumps most new information within hours.\n\nWhy this happens: Your brain is constantly filtering what's \"worth keeping.\"\n\nUnless information gets reinforced, it assumes it's not important.\n\nThe sharpest decline in retention occurs within the first twenty minutes and is significant within the first hour.\n\nHere's the simple technique that changes everything:\n\nSpaced repetition.\nInstead of cramming once, you review at strategic intervals:\n- Review #1: Within 24 hours\n- Review #2: After 3 days\n- Review #3: After 1 week\n- Review #4: After 1 month\nInstead of trying to cram all the information in at once, repeat the learning multiple times after the initial lesson. This strategy helps to increase memory retention.\n\nEach review \"resets\" the forgetting curve, making memories stronger and longer-lasting.\n\nWhy most training fails: Companies spend millions on one-time workshops, then wonder why nothing sticks.\n\nEmployees forget 90% within a week because there's no follow-up.\n\nHow I apply this: \n→ Set calendar reminders to review key concepts 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week after learning \n→ Use spaced repetition apps like Anki for important information\n→ Break training into smaller chunks with built-in review cycles \n→ Take notes, then revisit them at increasing intervals\n\nThe difference between forgetting and mastering isn't talent. It's timing.\n\nWhat's one skill you learned but lost because you didn't review it?",

The Swiss reState Foundation estimates that USD4trn of personal wealth is looking for a new home (that's about the same size as the German economy). \n\nGovernments must react quickly to the threat that the most economically productive elements of society can and will move. They are no longer prisoners of geography. And many fine countries around the world welcome them with open arms, albeit sotto voce.\n\nAs the sense of malaise and disenfranchisement grows in many high-tax, liberal democracies, Governments need to roadmap an environment in which they are left with ever fewer net contributors and ever more net recipients. What will their solution be? To enhance the tax burden on those that are left? To build ever greater barriers to the outflow of talent and resources? To legislate and regulate ever more, as the need to control outweighs the need to collaborate? \n\nTo say we live in interesting times is an understatement.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eXNkMrAt",

For almost the same time, she has worked in a nursery in Dubai.\nRecently, her husband’s job shifted to Abu Dhabi, and the family moved there. But every day, she still travels all the way from Abu Dhabi to Dubai for work. The long commute leaves her tired, and she admitted she isn’t comfortable with this new routine.\nI gently suggested she explore job opportunities in Abu Dhabi. It would save her time, energy, and give her more balance in life.\nHer response stayed with me:\n 👉 “I’ve been in the same nursery for 15 years. I’m scared to move out of my comfort zone.”\nIt reminded me how often we all hold on to the familiar—even when it starts working against us. Change feels risky, but sometimes staying the same costs us much more.\nStepping out of our comfort zone isn’t easy. It takes courage. But it also creates space for growth, balance, and new opportunities we may not even imagine today.\nThat short metro conversation was a reminder for me too: comfort zones feel safe, but they can also keep us stuck.\n✨ Sometimes, one brave step into the unknown can make life not only different—but better.\n👉 Have you ever faced a moment where stepping out of your comfort zone changed your life for the better?\n\nhashtag\n#ComfortZone \nhashtag\n#Growth \nhashtag\n#Mindset \nhashtag\n#LifeLessons \nhashtag\n#CareerJourney \nhashtag\n#Leadership",

More mediocrity.\n\nBut AI lets us flip this model completely.\n\nInstead of creating a massive directory, AI allows us to identify and amplify the best specialist and increase their impact by connecting them with the right people, and help them serve at scale—without losing depth or quality.\n\nThis doesn’t just improve access—it widens the gap between an outstanding specialist and an average one.\n\nWho are these outstanding specialists?\n\nThey are not just practitioners. They are custodians of knowledge.\n\n- A generational Ayurvedic specialist, trained in formulations passed down for centuries\n- A martial arts master, upholding the traditions of a 500-year-old school \n- A yoga teacher with 30+ years of mastery—beyond trends, beyond commercial studios \n- A Vedic scholar with five decades of deep study, distilling wisdom modern science is only beginning to validate\n- A music guru from an ancient gharana, carrying forward a lineage of Nada Yoga\n- A specialist who has been using a thousand-year-old recipe to create therapeutic food\n\nThese people don’t just teach—they embody the practice.\n\nBut the problem with most marketplaces is that they treat expertise as a commodity. They optimize for more options, more surface-level engagement. And in doing so, they dilute real knowledge.\n\nWe need to do the opposite. \n\nA few outstanding specialists can now impact thousands if not millions—without losing depth. \n\nPersonalization can scale—without becoming generic. \n\nAuthenticity can remain the foundation—not an afterthought.\n\nBecause in lifestyle businesses, quality matters far more than quantity.\n\nAI done right doesn’t dilute expertise—it elevates it.\n\nWe need a new way to access the rarest and most profound knowledge. \n\nNot from whoever shows up on a directory, but from those who have truly lived it.",

And that is about holistic growth. Parents could focus on creating self belief and confidence in their children, because when you have that , everything else will follow. We were both very fortunate to have parents who instilled those life skills and believed in us even as we didn’t excel in academics. We are indebted for that upbringing.

Here's what I am doing wrong/right:\n\nLet's talk about what I'm doing wrong first.\n\n→ Value-add commenting - Justin uses the \"CEA\" formula (Compliment, Expand, Ask) on 5-10 posts daily with surgical precision. Meanwhile, I comment when something randomly catches my eye.\n\n→ Micro-interviews - He actively reaches out to influencers with thoughtful, specific questions about their expertise, then shares their responses as posts (with permission). \n\n→ Trend translation - He has Google Alerts set up for industry keywords and is consistently first to explain what breaking news means for his specific niche. \n\n→ Early comment engagement - He replies to the first 6-8 comments within minutes of posting, which signals to LinkedIn's algorithm that his content is engaging and boosts reach. \n\n→ Systematic repurposing - He turns one piece of research or insight into 5-6 different posts: the main insight, a contrarian take, a personal story illustrating it, a how-to guide, a mistake to avoid, and a future prediction. \n\n→ Strategic collaborations - I used to create joint content, co-host discussions, and cross-promote with other creators in my space. But I've completely neglected this, missing out on audience overlap and compound growth opportunities.\n\nWhat I'm doing right:\n\n→ Posting consistently - I publish 4 times a week without fail. This consistency has built trust with my audience and kept me top-of-mind.\n→ Killer hooks - I spend genuine time crafting that first line to stop the scroll.

          "content": "Very insightful last of couple of weeks! I spoke at the Epicon Family Office Summit in Dubai about tokenization and its role in reshaping real-world asset strategies.\n\nIn real estate, tokenization is gaining significant traction. Dubai’s recent moves, including partnerships with Prypco and Crypto.com, are laying the groundwork for fractional ownership and new investor models in a regulated digital environment, opening up a rather illiquid asset class to a much broader range of investors. \n\nJust days later, in Berlin, I joined the national Cell & Gene Therapy Investor Day. The takeaway: AI is already accelerating discovery, which will push comprehensive prevention, longevity and personalized medicine from vision into reality.\n\nIn my day-to-day work and conversations with professional services firms, I increasingly see GenAI use cases gaining real traction, particularly in automating analysis, processing transactions and research. Much of what was once entry-level work is quietly being eliminated.\n\nWhat connects all of this? Technology is disrupting how we invest, operate, and plan. And in contrast to past transformations we are seeing a speed of change which is 5-10x.\n\nThe implication for business leaders: These shifts aren’t theoretical. They are already reshaping career paths, operating models, and strategic priorities. A similar speed and agility of decision making and implementation is needed to keep pace with these technology and market changes.\n\n\nhashtag\n#Tokenization \nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#GenAI \nhashtag\n#Longevity \nhashtag\n#DigitalAssets \nhashtag\n#HealthcareInnovation \nhashtag\n#FutureOfWork \nhashtag\n#CFOLeadership \nhashtag\n#Dubai \nhashtag\n#Berlin",

          "content": "Back in Dubai, I can reflect on last week’s meetings across Europe and during the TECH Europe Summit in Heilbronn. The visit revealed something I hadn’t seen in a while specifically in Germany: renewed optimism and a willingness to move beyond the status quo.\n \nSome key takeaways:\n \n🔹 Tech Sovereignty Demands Urgency and Talent\n \nEurope’s digital and technological sovereignty is being diluted, by fragmented regulation (27 different legal regimes and diverging views on sovereignty) and protracted investment cycles. The US and China lead and to catch up will be a momentous task. But individual initiatives are gaining momentum and global talents are increasingly looking again at Europe to build their career. To continue that the environment incl. incentives, regulation and tax policies need to improve to be competitive. \n \n🔹 AI is everywhere and finance has to lead \n \nWe’re seeing a rapid shift from “death by a thousand POCs” to real-world enterprise deployments. The age of pilots is ending; scale is the new imperative with automation moving from tasks to processes. AI is now delivering tangible impact across core enterprise functions—including finance, where I’ve seen firsthand how automation and real-time insights are reshaping decision-making, compliance, risk management and resource allocation. \n \n🔹 Regulation vs. Innovation\n \nEurope remains a global leader f.ex. in trusted, high-quality healthcare and pharma - but it’s losing ground. Meanwhile, AI is transforming the sector, from early-stage molecule screening to automating R&D workflows. For Europe to remain competitive, three enablers are critical: \n• Streamlined regulatory pathways \n• Access to anonymized patient data in accessible formats and structure \n• Sovereign AI deployed in trusted, compliant environments \n \nWill the current optimism have a lasting effect and lead European companies to invest more locally again and will needed policy changes be implemented quickly? One way to move forward swiftly is to look to the Middle East. \n \nThe UAE and broader GCC are accelerating and emerging as a serious tech player, with unified leadership and fast policy execution. Its major investments and evolving policy framework in AI, blockchain (incl. tokenization of real estate) and data infrastructure could be a basis for a deeper partnership between Europe and the UAE. Combining Europe’s domain strength and regulatory credibility with the UAE’s agility and investment power can unlock sovereign, scalable, and secure innovation models.\n \nWould welcome your thoughts on this.",

          "content": "The Day I Almost Designed My Way Into Exile 😂\n\nEvery creative person has that one career moment where they desperately wish for a Ctrl+Z. Mine? Oh, it was historic—literally.\n\nPicture this: \na proud day, welcoming the king of a country. I was tasked with designing his official greeting. The photo was perfect, his smile radiated, and everything was falling into place… except for one thing. I thought, “Hey, let’s get creative! Let’s flip the image so he’s looking into the frame.” Genius, right? I mean, how could anything possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, let me tell you: everything went wrong.\n\nIn my brilliance, I flipped the image. But here’s the kicker—flipping it also switched the king’s raised hand from his right to his left. Yup, I accidentally had the king of a country waving to his people with the wrong hand. And as fate would have it, the design was published in an official newspaper. To the entire country.\n\nThe reaction? Let’s just say the fallout wasn’t subtle. The whole newspaper was shut down for a while. I was ready to pack my bags and move to a remote island where no one could find me. All this because I wanted my design to look “balanced.”\n\nI learned two things that day:\n 1. Never underestimate the power of a flipped image.\n 2. Never overestimate the power of “it’ll probably be fine.”\n\nHave you ever made a career mistake so big it could’ve made headlines? Let’s hear your “Ctrl+Z moments” and laugh together (or cry—it’s fine).\n\n\nhashtag\n#CreativeDesign \nhashtag\n#DesignFails \nhashtag\n#CtrlZMoments \nhashtag\n#WhatWasIThinking \nhashtag\n#GraphicDisaster \nhashtag\n#LessonsFromThePast \nhashtag\n#StillHere",

          "content": "We all hear it constantly: “Think outside the box!” But lately, I have a feeling no one’s in the box anymore – it’s completely empty! We’ve gotten so comfortable breaking the rules that the box itself seems to have lost its value. It’s almost as if the creative world is in a competition to see who can go the furthest from reason and logic.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love crazy ideas – the wilder, the better! But there’s a difference between pushing the boundaries and throwing the map out the window. Real creativity, the kind that makes an impact, isn’t just about “breaking the rules” – it’s about knowing which rules to break and why.\n\nAnd sometimes, I wonder what those big brand presentations look like. Like, imagine being in the room when someone pitched Xiaomi’s new logo: “It’s not a circle. It’s not a square. It’s… kind of round-ish!” Or when someone decided Jaguar’s fierce logo needed to go from wild predator to friendly Barbie cat. And yet, the deal was signed, sealed, and delivered for astronomical numbers. I can just picture the client’s face, nodding seriously while thinking, “Yes, yes… this semi-circle is definitely worth a few million!” 😂\n\nMaybe it’s time we look inside the box again. Not to play it safe, but to rediscover meaning, purpose, and ideas that don’t just scream for attention but actually make sense. I’m all for being bold and rebellious, but if everything is “outside the box,” maybe the most radical move is to look back inside it – and find something worth saying.\n\n\nhashtag\n#CreativeDesign \nhashtag\n#BrandStrategy \nhashtag\n#Marketing \nhashtag\n#DesignInspiration \nhashtag\n#Creativity \nhashtag\n#Branding \nhashtag\n#DesignThinking \nhashtag\n#Innovation \nhashtag\n#CreativeProcess \nhashtag\n#Advertising \nhashtag\n#ArtDirection \nhashtag\n#DigitalMarketing \nhashtag\n#CreativeLeadership \nhashtag\n#DesignTrends \nhashtag\n#MarketingStrategy \nhashtag\n#Jaguar \nhashtag\n#Xiaomi",

          "content": "I’ll never forget the first time I saw someone working in Photoshop. I was absolutely mesmerized – sitting there with my mouth wide open, watching the magic unfold on screen. It was like watching someone transform reality right in front of my eyes, with just a few clicks, layers, and creative instincts.\n\nFrom that moment, I was hooked. I knew this was what I wanted to do. I dove headfirst into the world of creative design, determined to learn everything I could – every tool, every technique, every trick that could bring my ideas to life.\n\nDesign isn’t just a skill; it’s a passion that drives me every day. Whether it’s crafting a brand, building a visual story, or exploring the newest technology, I’m always chasing that feeling I had during my first encounter with Photoshop. It’s about pushing boundaries, mastering the craft, and discovering what’s possible.\n\nI’ve always loved the saying, “Work what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.” For me, creative design is that kind of work – the kind that feels more like play, more like passion, and never like a chore.\n\nBut let’s be real – it’s also a hardcore job. \nLate nights, endless revisions, and coffee-fueled sprints are all part of the magic. So yes, I love it… but I’ve definitely worked a few hundred days in my life! 😂",

          "content": "In today’s world, leadership often feels like balancing on shifting ground. Global pressures, financial trade-offs and team dynamics can pull leaders in many directions at once.\n \nThe pace is fast, the pressures are immense and it can be hard to pause, reflect and notice the potential already inside you.\n \nI have lived this myself. Sometimes growth came in a crisis. Other times because a leader or coach helped me see strengths I hadn’t noticed.\n \nI see coaching as the ‘epigenetics switch’ of leadership. Just as DNA holds vast potential but much of it stays dormant waiting for the right signal, each of us carries unexpressed strengths and wisdom. Coaching creates the conditions for those hidden capacities to awaken.\n \nThat is why I am beginning this next chapter as a coach. Alongside my transformation and consulting work, coaching is a natural complement. It deepens how I support leaders not just with strategies but with the inner clarity to carry them forward.\n \nThrough coaching, I am looking to create rare safe space where leaders feel seen, be authentic and unlock what is hidden in the noise of daily work. \n\nMy endeavour is to \n 1. create awareness that open new perspectives\n 2. help make tough choices easier to see and act on \n 3. support small, practical steps that build trust in one’s own capacity\n \nWhen leaders reconnect with their essence, they inspire ripple effects that strengthen teams, organizations and society. \n\nSo here is your invitation, if you or your team are exploring a new way forward, I would welcome a conversation.\n \n\nI am grateful to those who invested in my International Coaching Federation journey with Erickson Coaching International specially my guru Gaurav Arora, MCC (ICF) and my accountability partners.

Tag them here or drop a comment. \n\n\nhashtag\n#Storytelling \nhashtag\n#LeadershipThroughNarratives \nhashtag\n#Dubai \nhashtag\n#UAE \nhashtag\n#CreativeFacilitation \nhashtag\n#LearningNeverStops \nhashtag\n#akspeaks",

But we miss asking, \"85% accurate at what? Predicting the past or predicting your future?\"\n\nMost AI demos follow the same script. Show impressive accuracy numbers. Promise efficiency gains. Present quick timelines. But it rarely shows how these claims were tested.\n\nHere's what I've learned about testing AI:\n\nBusiness Metrics are important. \"Hours saved\", \"FTE re-calibration\", \"costs saved\", \"revenue increase\". Also, define the decision and the cost of being wrong (false positives vs false negatives)\n\nEqually important question: Is your AI making the right decisions when it matters? And how do you know?\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁, check what's missing. Seasonal changes, competitor actions, market shifts, local events (Ramadan/Diwali), VAT or policy changes, promotions. Run data-leakage checks to avoid biased attribution.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱, test the method, not just the math. Validate problem framing, target definition, feature engineering and constraints. The smartest algorithm is useless if it's solving the wrong problem.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱, test on real-world, out-of-time data. If your AI only works on training data, it's not intelligence-it's memorization. Use holdout tests and rolling back tests. And optimize expected value, not generic accuracy.\n\n𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘁𝗵, test different scenarios. What works in \nhashtag\n#Dubai might fail in London. What works in Q1 might break in Q4. Include shocks (supply disruptions), demand spikes (holiday seasons), and channel shifts.\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗳𝘁𝗵, establish governance & human-in-the-loop. Define approval points, model explanations, and escalation paths for high-risk decisions.\n\n𝗦𝗶𝘅𝘁𝗵, monitor constantly. Watch for data changes and business shifts. Retrain regularly and document updates as conditions change to minimise data and concept drifts.\n\nThe Russian saying 'Trust, but verify' was made famous by President Reagan. In the AI age, this isn't just good advice. It's survival.\n\nEvery algorithm will touch your revenue, reputation, and competitive position for years. As we are RTD AI models, you could ask validation questions like these:\n\nFor marketing attribution: Show me how this model performed when we paused Google Ads for a month.\n\nFor sales forecasting: What happens to accuracy when we remove our top-performing rep's data?\n\nFor pricing algorithms: How does this model handle flash sales vs. regular discount periods?\n\nFor investment recommendations: What's our override protocol when the model suggests 20% below market rate?\n\nFor customer churn prediction: Show me the false positive rate—how many 'loyal' customers did we unnecessarily discount?\n\nPreparing \nhashtag\n#AI for \nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation? - Trust by Authority → Trust by Process → Trust by Verification.",

They predict which prospects will respond to rate promotions or property showcases. Three models:\n• Promo propensity - predicting purchase likelihood\n• Promo uplift - ROI between promotion vs. no-promotion \n• Content propensity and effectiveness – eliminate non-performing content\n\nThe Activation Layer (Scale After Foundation):\nPicture this: within an hour of promotion approval, can your system launch personalized mortgage campaigns across property portals, broker networks, and prospect touchpoints?\n\n𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 must connect upstream data with downstream execution.\n• Workflow Orchestration manages offers and AI content across campaigns\n• Integrated Order Management Systems (catalogue, tag, distribute, redeem) delivering automation at enterprise scale\n\nBut models and creatives without distribution are just expensive spreadsheets.\n𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 must process signals instantly, enabling real-time personalization\n• Customer signal processing through journey orchestration and optimizing messaging\n• Integration across multivendor advertising systems for a consistent brand experience\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 closes the loop through centralized reporting - executives track revenue impact while operators optimize campaigns. \n\nThe sequence matters more than the technology. \n\nBuild your data foundation first. Get your decision engines humming. Layer on creative systems and distribution networks only after the foundation is solid. Skip steps, and you'll join the 65-70% still waiting for ROI.\n\n\nhashtag\n#AgenticAI \nhashtag\n#AIUAE \nhashtag\n#GenAI \nhashtag\n#CustomerExperience \nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation \nhashtag\n#Ecom \nhashtag\n#RealEstate",

On 22-Jan-2024 as I wrapped up my \nhashtag\n#kpmgindia innings, it had been a complete 16 years; no, they somehow didn't feel or appear that long to me. A wonderful 7 in Mumbai & then even more fulfilling 9 in NCR Delhi, with so many more cities in India and the globe covered. The years have flown by so fast and in that period we together created a business, which to me and to many I know is also a feeling. A feeling that represents so many things, so many emotions – passion, purpose, warmth, belief, trust and belonging.\n \nWhat we hold individually and as a team, as a professional and personal relationship, far outweighs any other aspect. The sincerity, commitment & desire to excel in everything we do at KPMG, as we solve our client’s business challenges, has been the bedrock of a meaningful work environment. Each and every one from our teams, our clients and all the internal functions is what makes it really happen. I will forever be indebted & grateful to each and every one of you. It is your trust and friendship, that I owe my successes to. Must also acknowledge those who had moved on earlier & made a big impact. I have equally well enjoyed the falls, the disagreements and at times some uncomfortable moments\n– truly cherish them all. Please do pardon me for my missteps or when I may\nhave not lived up to your expectations, you can meet me separately for a drink or more, will be on me.\n \nIt's the lives we touch and the little parts of it that forever become embedded in our individual and collective story. \n \nA big heartfelt thank you to the firm’s leadership over these years, your belief and trust that you showed in me allowed me to take up different roles, newer challenges and give it my best. To all my colleagues and teams, from all service lines and functions in the firm, and most importantly to the MPAers spanning right from the day I joined on 21-Jan-2008 in Mumbai in the City Studio office. \n\nRespect and Gratitude!!!\n\nRichard Rekhy Yezdi Nagporewalla Vinodkumar R.

          "content": "When we talk about AI or LLMs, it often sounds like one giant category. But not all models are built the same and more importantly, not all are meant to solve the same problems.\n\nThe future of AI is not just about bigger models, but about choosing the right type of model for the right context.\n\nHere is one way to classify LLMs:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Generalist LLMs\n\nBroad, versatile models trained on massive datasets across domains. They are designed to handle almost anything: from drafting content to coding assistance, brainstorming, or customer support.\n\nExamples: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta LLaMA.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Specialist LLMs\n\nFine-tuned for accuracy in a particular industry or vertical. These models understand compliance, jargon, and domain-specific challenges far better than generalists.\n\nExamples: BloombergGPT (finance), Med-PaLM (healthcare)\n\n⸻\n\n3. Lightweight / Edge LLMs\n\nSmaller and faster models optimized for efficiency. They are built for devices with limited compute, lower costs, or stricter privacy requirements—bringing AI closer to the edge.\n\nExamples: Mistral 7B, LLaMA-2-7B, Phi-3, Google Gemma.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Reasoning LLMs\n\nThe new wave of models designed for structured, step-by-step logical reasoning. Instead of just predicting text, they “think” through problems making them better at planning, problem solving, and decision support.\n\nExamples: DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1 models, K2 Think.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Agentic LLMs\n\nThe most advanced category—these don’t just respond, they act. By connecting to APIs, triggering workflows, and executing tasks autonomously, they behave like digital co-workers.\n\nExamples: OpenAI GPTs (custom agents), AutoGPT, LangChain-powered agents.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe real question is no longer “Which LLM is best?”\nIt is: “Which type of LLM is best for the problem I am solving?”\n\nA mobile-first app may need a Lightweight model.\nAn innovation lab may explore Reasoning or Agentic LLMs to unlock new possibilities.\n\n⸻\n\nThe takeaway:\n\nWe are moving from a world of “one-size-fits-all” AI to a future where LLMs are clustered, specialized, and chosen strategically.\n\nIf you had to pick one - would you start with a Generalist for broad coverage, or a Specialist for deep accuracy?\n\n\nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#LLM \nhashtag\n#Innovation \nhashtag\n#DataStrategy \nhashtag\n#Leadership",

Sensitive data exposed to unapproved platforms\n2. Lack of oversight and accountability\n3. Outputs inconsistent with business standards\n4. Compliance and regulatory violations\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nShadow AI is proof of demand: people want AI to make work faster, smarter, and easier. Instead of blocking it, leaders should channel it.\n\nThe Path Forward:-\n1. Provide company-approved AI platforms\n2. Establish clear governance and usage policies\n3. Educate teams on responsible adoption\n4. Monitor usage to align AI with strategic goals\n\nShadow AI is not a threat it’s a signal. A signal that your workforce is ready to embrace AI today. The question is: Will organisations lead that adoption responsibly, or play catch up?",

Gender equality isn’t about HR policies alone; it’s about everyday behaviors that all of us choose to challenge or reinforce.\n\nEarly in my career, I’ve seen brilliant women share ideas that were overlooked—only to gain traction when repeated by someone else. I made it a rule: always credit ideas to their originators. This small shift changes the dynamic, ensuring voices were heard based on merit. \n\nThis IWD, let’s move beyond celebrations, greeting cards and gifts packs and commit to real change — one decision, one acknowledgment, one shift at a time.\n\n\nhashtag\n#IWD25 \nhashtag\n#LinkedInNewsMiddleEast",

They poured millions into CRM, ERP, and automation, expecting efficiency and growth. Sadly, the results have been underwhelming thus far.\n\nA deep dive revealed three structural challenges – \n(i) Tech without strategy – While the Gen AI hype is real, buying the latest tools without aligning them with business objectives and execution synergies proved to be a costly misstep \n(ii) People push back – High resistance and lack of proactivity as employees felt transformation was forced upon them rather than designed for them\n(iii) Siloed systems – Finance, Sales, and Ops ran on disconnected platforms based on individual preferences rather than architectural coherence, leading to data chaos instead of clarity\n\nWe agreed the way forward needed to include the following to put the rocket-ship back on course:\n✅ Pause and Reflect - Revisit the North Star, Operating Model, and Processes with the key principle that technology should fit the business needs, not the other way around\n✅ Put People First – Make voices heard and provide a safe space for experimentation, innovation and dialogue. Disagreements if addressed right, create transformation evangelists who will champion the cause\n✅ Integrate for Impact – Create an enterprise wide system and data architecture enabled by a connected ecosystem (ERP + CRM + AI) to fuel real-time decision-making and business agility \n\n\nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation \nhashtag\n#EnterpriseTech \nhashtag\n#CRM \nhashtag\n#FinanceTransformation \nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#ChangeManagement",

I wear it sometimes, and my wife has told me more than once that I look weird in it.\n\n\"You are a 62 year old retired Tata man\", she said, \"such a loud and jazzy cap does not suit you at all.\" And then she added - \"But then it is your head, after all.\"\n\nI told her that these colourful caps were very popular with people of all ages, everywhere. As an example of this, I pointed out - \"Take a look at these pictures of people on the beaches of Hawaii. They are wearing these sort of coloured caps all the time.\"\n\nA few days later, my wife came back from a shopping expedition to Westside with her own bucket cap, which had checks in blue and grey. I thought that this was my chance to get back at her.\n\n\"So if you thought these colourful caps are weird, why have you bought one now?\", I asked her.\n\nShe responded immediately - \"Harish, I remembered what you had told me about people wearing these caps on the beaches of Hawaii. And I found this beautiful cap at Westside for just Rs. 499. So I bought it.\"\n\nAnd then she added - \"Now, both of us have these caps, so we are well prepared for our Hawaii holiday. There is only one step left now - for you to book our tickets to Hawaii. And by the way, I am fine with Mauritius as well. But can we please fly business class this time?\"\n\nI thought of my depleting credit card, and wondered why I had ever brought up the topic of these caps today. But I also paused for a moment to consider what my wife had achieved - never before had anyone in the world got such a high return on investment (ROI) by buying a small coloured hat.\n\nSo be very careful about the subjects that you bring up with your partner. They can have unintended consequences. Wish you a wonderful weekend, wherever you are - in Mumbai or Bangalore or Delhi or Hawaii.\n\nLook forward to your kind comments. Words of consolation are also welcome. Thank you.\n\n(Note : This is, for better or worse, a near-real-life story and not a promotional post for Westside. Having said that, I must add the disclaimer that Westside is my wife’s and my own favourite lifestyle store.)\n\n\nhashtag\n#caps \nhashtag\n#vacation \nhashtag\n#smile \nhashtag\n#humour \nhashtag\n#weekend",

These centers have evolved from cost-saving units into sophisticated innovation hubs driving global R&D and AI initiatives. However, does this growth translate into genuine global leadership roles and strategic decision-making authority for professionals in India?\n\nWhile capabilities have advanced, many GCCs still primarily function as complex back-office operations, with P&L ownership and key strategic decisions resting at global headquarters. \n\nIn my new article, \"Reality Check: Are Global Roles in Indian GCCs Just Hype?\", I delve into this disconnect. I explore the data behind the promises, examine sectoral differences, and discuss what it takes for a GCC to truly become a center of excellence.\n\nFor a comprehensive analysis of the real opportunities and challenges within India's GCC landscape, read the full article here\n\n\nhashtag\n#GCC \nhashtag\n#GlobalCapabilityCenters \nhashtag\n#India",

I leave with gratitude, for the experiments, the pressure, the people, and the trust placed in me during a time of transformation and exponential growth. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to the great team I had the privilege to lead who really were the core drivers of all the successes that came along the way.\n\nTo the leadership, thank you for the openness to ideas. To my colleagues, thank you for shaping me as a professional, a peer, and a better human being.\n\nAs I ease into my next role, I carry this reminder with me:\nA diamond is just a piece of coal that did well under pressure.\n\nLast but not the least, the move comes with exiting UAE as well. UAE shall enjoy the most special place in my heart as I never felt away from home. I am truly amazed with the fantastic ecosystem the Great Leadership of this Great Country has built, and the welcoming & tolerant attitude of the people is truly inspiring. \n\nFriends are forever, so there is no goodbye for them. We stay in touch as usual, always!",

A song he wrote, composed, recorded, and produced entirely on his own. No team meetings, no project managers, just raw passion, creativity, and the kind of determination that reminds me why we chase our dreams in the first place.\n\nWatching him pour his heart into something he believes in—staying up late perfecting melodies, learning new software, pushing through creative blocks—has been humbling. It's reminded me that while our careers matter and provide important structure and purpose in our lives, there's something magical about witnessing pure, unfiltered creativity driven by nothing but love for the craft.\n\nAs professionals, we often measure success in titles, metrics, and achievements. But sometimes the most meaningful victories happen in bedrooms, garages or attics, where teenagers and dreamers alike proves that age is just a number when passion meets persistence.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of him, not just for the beautiful music he's created, but for showing me that the best work—whether it's in a corporate office or a home studio—comes from that place where skill meets genuine inspiration.\n\nIf you have a moment, I'd love for you to experience what he's created.\n\n🎶 You can listen to his song here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dM-gSqbf\n\nAnd follow him here :\nhttps://lnkd.in/dhtWgMsY\n\nSometimes supporting young dreamers is as simple as pressing play.

Seeing our strategy come to fruition in such competitive marketplace is incredibly rewarding.\n\nSpecial thanks to my inspiring leader HOD and MD for the support and belief in our international expansion mission. While activating new markets is a slower and more challenging process than local UAE markets, this award proves that perseverance and resilience can make miracles happen.

Most teams struggle not just with targets, but also with things like delayed tools, scattered support, or simply not having the right space to welcome clients confidently.\n\nThat’s not what I wanted for my team.\n\nSo we renovated the entire office.\nNot because it wasn’t good before, but because I knew we could do better.\n\nWe upgraded the space for the people who spend most of their day in it.\n\nHere’s what changed:\n→ A warm, welcoming reception that sets the tone for clients and team\n→ Private meeting rooms for undisturbed, focused conversations\n→ A master screen to showcase our USPs with clarity and impact\n→ Collaborative zones that encourage fresh ideas and stronger teamwork\n\nEvery week, I personally sit with my team to understand what’s working and what’s holding them back, not just to talk numbers, but to listen.\n\nBecause performance isn’t driven by pressure.\nIt’s driven by support, systems, and culture.\n\nSince the renovation, I’ve seen the shift in energy, in ownership, in results.\n\nAt Danube, we don’t wait for problems to become patterns. We upgrade what matters before it becomes a limitation.\n\nAnd the same goes for the leadership, it's about building the kind of foundation your team can grow on.\n\nDoes your workspace reflect the ambition you're chasing?\n\n\nhashtag\n#LuxuryRealEstate \nhashtag\n#WorkCulture \nhashtag\n#DanubeProperties \nhashtag\n#Entrepreneurship \nhashtag\n#Leadership \nhashtag\n#Teamwork",

Together, we are proud to have sold more than 20 units in AIDA, our project in Oman, the masterpiece of our portfolio.\n\nThank you for your trust PLANOGROUP. We will continue to present the best opportunities to your clients in our current and future projects 🤝",

          "content": "The Shared Well of Old Dubai – A Business Lesson\n\nLong before the glittering skyline, Dubai’s communities relied on one common well. Families drew what they needed, and the balance was kept. Until a few traders thought: “If I take just a little more, I’ll profit faster.” Soon everyone followed, and the well ran dry.\n\nThat’s the Tragedy of the Commons.\n\nModern UAE Business Parallels\n\n🔹 Real Estate Brokers in Business Bay\n\n One broker thinks: “If I message every investor 10 times a day, I’ll close faster.” Soon, every broker floods inboxes and WhatsApp. Investors stop picking calls altogether. The whole industry’s credibility suffers.\n\n🔹 Mall Tenants\n\n A retail shop in Deira Mall cranks up its music to pull customers. Others do the same. Soon, the mall feels like chaos—customers walk out. Everyone loses business.\n\n🔹 Logistics & Warehousing\n\n A few operators overbook loading bays “just in case.” Trucks pile up, delays grow, and the shared infrastructure collapses. Instead of faster service, everyone faces angry clients.\n\n🔹 Tourism & Hospitality\n\n One desert safari operator cuts costs by overusing fragile dunes. Others copy. Tourists find eroded, crowded landscapes, and Dubai loses a unique attraction.\n\n🔹 Corporate Trust\n\nA businessman inflates short-term profits, thinking, “No one will notice.” But if every company does the same, investors lose faith in the whole market.\nThe Lesson for UAE Entrepreneurs\n\nDubai thrives because it balances individual ambition with shared prosperity. \n\nThe commons today is not a well or a pasture—it’s:\n- Investor trust in Dubai as a safe, profitable market\n- Shared infrastructure like freezones, roads, and ports\n- The reputation of our industries\n\nBusinessmen who protect the commons—by being ethical, professional, and sustainable—win in the long run. Those who exploit it may gain a quick dirham, but they risk drying out the well for everyone.\n\nThe real winners are those who think beyond their own bucket, and ensure the well remains full for tomorrow.",

Every idea — no matter how small — becomes a brick in the foundation of something greater.\n\nSo instead of asking, “How fast can I reach the top?” maybe the better question is, “What am I learning along the way that will make the climb worth it?”\n\nBecause in business, as in life, the value lies not in the finish line, but in the staircase we choose to build.\n\n\nhashtag\n#Leadership \nhashtag\n#BusinessGrowth \nhashtag\n#SuccessMindset \nhashtag\n#Entrepreneurship \nhashtag\n#LearningEveryday \nhashtag\n#GrowthJourney \nhashtag\n#MotivationForLeaders",

The sales rep’s mindset.\n\nEvery demo, pitch, and follow-up isn’t just about the buyer; it’s about what’s happening in the rep’s head.\nBecause the rep’s psychology is the real deal-maker (or deal-breaker).\n\nA sales rep isn’t a neutral messenger of value. They shape the outcome by deciding, in real time:\n\nWhether to ask for the meeting or hesitate\nWhether to follow up one more time or let it drop\nWhether to stand firm on value or give a discount out of fear\nWhether to bounce back after rejection or let it drain the next call\n\nThose are the hidden, daily decisions that don’t show up in a playbook, but they determine whether deals move forward or die quietly.\n\nAnd this is why sales leadership often misses the mark.\n\nWe double down on scripts, tools, and training for technique. But if the rep’s inner game is broken, if they lack confidence, resilience, and belief, the best playbook in the world won’t save the deal.\n\nGreat leaders know this.\nThey don’t just coach what to say.\nThey coach how to think.\n\nBecause sales isn’t just psychology for the buyer, it’s psychology on both sides of the table.\nIf you want better sales results, start by understanding the seller’s mind.\n\n\nhashtag\n#SalesPsychology \nhashtag\n#SalesLeadership \nhashtag\n#MindsetMatters \nhashtag\n#SalesPerformance \nhashtag\n#SalesCoaching \nhashtag\n#SalesEnablement \nhashtag\n#B2BSalea",

Their stay at The Chedi Muscat immersed them in the resort that put Oman's luxury-travel offering on the map. \n\nAppearing in the US publication Airmail, Catherine's first feature considered the Arabian splendour offered by both resorts alongside their special settings and history. A colourful six-page feature for BOAT International Media, her second commission documents Oman's sensitive evolution into a discreet, cultured holiday destination for sophisticated travellers, where The Chedi Muscat \"is perhaps the ultimate oasis\" not just nationwide but in the Middle East. Accompanying her warm words throughout are images taken by Sir Don, a wonderful partnership that beautifully showcases the best of Oman in word and image - much to the delight of our client.",

The truth is simple – Etihad Rail is going to be a big value driver.\n\nAreas like Dubai South, Al Furjan, JVC, DLRC, IMPZ, Business Bay, and Dubai Creek Harbour will all feel the impact. We’re talking better connectivity, stronger price growth, and more rental demand.\n\nFor homeowners, it’s a chance at better resale value (depending on the project, location, and quality). For investors, it’s about getting in early on communities along the rail corridor before prices really move.\n\n(Below Image from below https://lnkd.in/d4dznuCX)\n\nhashtag\n#Dubai \nhashtag\n#RealEstate \nhashtag\n#Advisory \nhashtag\n#EtihadRail \nhashtag\n#Investor",

          "content": "Foundations in Dubai are a unique legal structure, primarily used by wealthy individuals and families to manage and protect both personal and business assets. Real estate ownership through a corporate entity offers several important benefits over purchasing as an individual, particularly in terms of financial efficiency, legal protection, and long-term stability.\n\nRecently, I advised a client in Dubai and who is a US citizen, while his siblings hold different nationalities. This made inheritance and succession planning a complex challenge for the family, particularly for their children.\n\nAfter reviewing various structures and consulting with advisors, the DIFC Foundation (recognized by the Dubai Land Department for real estate ownership) stood out as the most suitable solution. It provided clarity, governance, and a framework to ensure a smooth transition of wealth across generations. The client is now preparing to establish this foundation.\n\nWe are seeing more clients exploring corporate vehicles like foundations. For international investors in particular, the appeal is clear: security, confidentiality, and structured succession planning.",

The architecture itself is truly inspiring, a masterpiece that blends innovation with culture.\n\nWhat fascinated me most was how the design applies biophilic principles, particularly in its use of natural light. The iconic dome filters the intense desert sun into a soft “rain of light,” creating an atmosphere that feels both calming and thought-provoking. This interplay of light, water, and space makes you feel deeply connected to your surroundings, turning the visit into much more than just viewing art.\n\nFor me, it was a reminder of how architecture, when designed with nature in mind, can shape emotions and create meaningful human experiences. It also made me reflect on how the same principles can inspire us in our professional lives, whether in design, leadership, or innovation.\nCreating solutions that are not only functional, but also human-centered .\n.\n.\n.\n\nhashtag\n#louvre \nhashtag\n#abudhabi \nhashtag\n#architecture \nhashtag\n#interior_design \nhashtag\n#natural_light \nhashtag\n#museum \nhashtag\n#biophilic_design \nhashtag\n#biophilia",

Ahmad Jamal has named the app “KyaBaat” which translates to “What do you want to say?” It is the first Urdu app of its kind and will revolutionize the caregiving of patients who can't speak due to reasons like stroke or tracheostomy. \n\nNow, they will be able to easily communicate their various needs such as hunger, pain, and emotions using this app. The clean graphical buttons of the app combined with clear voices with both male and female settings will bridge this gap. Ahmad has kept the app free with no advertisements as he didn't want to bother the patients with complicated maneuvers such as skipping ads and didn't want the essence of the app to be disturbed. It is free and it is in Urdu so that it is accessible to the entire Urdu-speaking population all over the world. \n\nPlease have a look at this app and give it a positive rating to encourage to continue on this remarkable journey of app development. Download the app from Google Play Store by either typing \"kyabaat\" or by going to this link: https://lnkd.in/ex4XhRB9 🔗 - Link in story.\n\n\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eYJNjHgu",

Palm Jebel Ali has 3 entry and exit points, whereas Palm Jumeirah only has 1, leading to better traffic flow\n\n3. Water circulation on Palm Jebel Ali is better due to multiple openings along the crescent, ensuring better water flow and clarity of water\n\n4. Villas on Palm Jebel Ali have a facelift and look more modern, with sustainability at the forefront. Whereas Palm Jumeirah villas are outdated.\n\n5. Price/sqft on Palm Jebel Ali is 3x less than on Palm Jumeirah, giving you a higher scope for capital appreciation \n\nMessage me now to submit your EOI 📥 \n\n\nhashtag\n#palmjebelali \nhashtag\n#palmjumeirah \nhashtag\n#dubai \nhashtag\n#realestate \nhashtag\n#dubairealestate \nhashtag\n#sustainability",
