          "content": "This is a masterclass you don’t want to miss. \n\nWatching Roger Federer speak to university students made me sit up and wonder—can we admire and respect him even more than we already do? \n\nHis words took me back to every master I’ve ever seen in action—whether on screen, in an office, or on the sports field. \n\nFederer, one of the greatest athletes of all time, didn’t just play tennis—he created magic with a racquet in hand. But through his speech, he reminds us that what seemed like magic was actually the product of relentless dedication and an unshakable work ethic. \n\nPeople thought he barely broke a sweat. Yet behind what the world saw as effortless genius was a man who spent countless hours practicing, strategizing, and failing. \n\nThat effortlessness? It’s a myth. \n\nMuch like Virat Kohli’s cover drive or Rohit Sharma’s pull shot. We assume it's pure talent, but in reality, they’ve practiced those shots a million times. \n\nThe same applies to fitness. There’s no magic formula. It’s years—decades—of clean eating, disciplined training, and consistent effort. \n\nIt never gets easier. You just get better. \n\nWhether we’re entrepreneurs, professionals, or artists, the lesson is clear—true mastery is not about ease but about persistence. \n\nThe ease you see is hard-earned. \n\n\"It's only a point,\" Federer said. In tennis, just like in life, not every serve goes our way. What matters is what we do next. \n\nDo you dwell on the missed shot, or do you prepare for the next one? \n\nDespite his global fame and near-mythical status, Federer speaks about life’s richness beyond the court. There’s something deeply humbling in how he calls himself a father first, cherishing simple joys like driving his kids to school. \n\nHis speech was more than just a pep talk for students. It was a masterclass in resilience, discipline, and perspective—the very principles that built one of the greatest sporting legacies. \n\nEverything he said is a guide to winning at life. With grace. With excellence. 🤩",

Semiotics is the study of how signs and symbols create and communicate meaning.\n\nA small example from everyday life: at my local supermarket, every price tag is black text on a yellow background. In semiotics, black and yellow together often mean warning, caution, or urgency: think hazard signs, bees, wasps, and certain snakes. In retail, that same color combination often signals discounts or special offers. So when you see it, you instinctively think bargain.\n\nBut here’s the trick; when every price tag uses that color scheme, it creates the illusion that everything is on sale, even when it’s not. Check the receipt, and the illusion disappears. A subtle, clever piece of retail psychology.\n\nSemiotics helps us ask not just what something means, but:\n• Where did this meaning come from?\n• Why is it being used here?\n• What reaction was it meant to provoke?\n• What does it remind people of?\n\nIt’s a way of tracing cultural cues back to their origins, understanding how they’ve found their way into our everyday perceptions.\n\nGrateful to Dr Rachel Lawes and Panos Dimitropoulos for opening my eyes to the ways semiotics shapes retail, shopping, and even the clever tricks that have us buying things we never planned to.\n\n\nhashtag\n#Semiotics \nhashtag\n#RetailStrategy \nhashtag\n#ConsumerPsychology \nhashtag\n#BrandStrategy \nhashtag\n#ShopperInsights \nhashtag\n#MarketingPsychology",

From leading strategic hiring to being part of a company driven by integrity and innovation.\n\nI am now excited to begin a new chapter as Director Talent Acquisition at DAMAC Group.\n\nWith over four decades of redefining luxury, from iconic towers and master planned communities to global collaborations in fashion and lifestyle, DAMAC blends scale with vision.\n\nFuelled by a vibrant induction, I got a real sense of DAMAC legacy, ambition and purpose. I saw how community impact is embedded in the company DNA. I also had the chance to visit DAMAC Hills 1, Cavalli Villas, Trump Golf Course and Paramount Hotel, a glimpse into the scale, creativity and vision that drive it all. Overall, I feel welcomed.\n\nAs DAMAC accelerates across real estate, data centers, hospitality, retail and tech driven ventures, I am energised by the opportunity to help shape the leadership and talent that will drive its next chapter.\n\nwww.damacgroup.com",

Every project depends on tracking material, labor, and equipment price trends. That is where construction cost indices come in. They provide real-time insights, helping developers budget smarter and avoid surprises.\n\nInstead of guessing, they can predict. Fewer cost overruns, better negotiations, and transparency.\n\nCost indices ensure fair escalation clauses and cost transparency, offering flexibility in a fluctuating market. But they need careful management to avoid discrepancies. In short, cost indices turn curiosity into clarity—and clarity into control.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gSTabrGM\n\n\nhashtag\n#contractmanagement \nhashtag\n#costindices \nhashtag\n#Construction",

Count how many photos you see of the breakfast buffet, the spa lobby, or a latte with perfectly dusted cocoa art. Now count how many pictures you find of the gym.\n\nExactly.\n\nAs someone who has spent over 20 years in this industry, opening hotels, rebranding them, building their reputations, and creating content pretty much 24/7, I still find myself baffled by this particular blind spot. We spend fortunes on treadmills, wellness consultants, Technogym equipment, even scented towels. And then… we don’t show it?\n\nI just got back from my staycation and yes, I was reminded, again, of what I wanted to rant about.\n\nHere’s the thing. I’m not a fitness influencer. But I am a hotel guest. And when I book my stay, I look at three things in this order:\n 1. Location\n 2. Wellness facilities (yes, the gym matters)\n 3. Room size and vibe\n\nAnd I’m not alone. Wellness is no longer a trend-it’s a lifestyle, and for many, a non negotiable. Guests want to know what they’re walking into. Yet most hotel content skips the gym entirely. We’ll see 25 angles of a croissant and 14 shots of an empty ballroom before we see a single decent image of the fitness space if we see one at all.\n\nFrom a content and commercial standpoint, this is a missed opportunity. And dare I say, a revenue leak. Because I know I’ve skipped so many bookings due to the lack of gym visibility. And I know others who have, too.\n\nIt doesn’t take much. A quick reel of someone mid workout, a carousel showing off your recovery zone, even a highlight tour of the space. Bonus points if you actually tell us who it’s for: jet lagged execs, spin addicts, gym rats, or just parents escaping the breakfast buffet chaos.\n\nWe’ve spent years reimagining hospitality around experiences, lifestyle, and personalization. And yet, in 2025, the gym is still treated like an afterthought. Maybe it’s time we moved it closer to the front.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, that same old croissant isn’t booking the room. But a gym that makes me want to train? That just might.\n\nWe want to work out every day. Just like we want to eat. Sleep. Breathe. \n\nSo please, show us the gym.",

          "content": "There are moments as a parent that just hit differently, and watching my 11-year-old daughter recently embark on her very first entrepreneurial adventure was definitely one of those proud moments worth sharing. Seeing her navigate the process – from ideation to execution – filled me with an overwhelming sense of pride and immense hope for the next generation of leaders.\n\nAs a woman leader in marketing, I've always championed innovation and strategic thinking, and believed in the power of initiative. To see those seeds blossom in my own girl at such a young age, and to witness her enthusiasm and learning, is truly rewarding and inspiring at the same time.\n\nWhat started as a passion project for beaded jewelry at home, led her to exhibit at a community market last year. This was followed by an incredible offer to collaborate for a limited edition collection by a woman-led (thanks a mil Eisha Ramrakhiani! ❤️) home-grown online jewelry brand - E3K, earlier this year.\nIn case you're in the mood for some retail therapy, you can find a link to her collection that just dropped - E3K x Jannat here: [https://e3k.shop/]\n\nDid it add work for us as parents? Yes, of course! But given both our marketing backgrounds, we made her understand that brands are not built overnight, and you need to be committed to the cause. From picking the name of her brand, to designing the logo, deciding the platforms to be present on, and crafting her brand story – she was part of it all and led with heart.\nThe best part was showing her how to run a business or shall I say 'show me the money'! Thankfully, she was quick to grasp that it doesn’t all go back into the piggy bank. Instead, the '3 F’s' of budgeting would apply to how she manages her income:\n- Fundamentals\n- Fun\n- Future self\n\nIt's a powerful reminder that the lessons we learn, and the opportunities we create, can truly shape incredible futures. Feeling extremely grateful and inspired today.\n\n(Jai Tolani) \n\n\nhashtag\n#SmallWins \nhashtag\n#Entrepreneurship\n\nhashtag\n#NextGenLeaders\n\nhashtag\n#ProudMom \nhashtag\n#WomenInBusiness\n\nhashtag\n#WomenInMarketing\n\nhashtag\n#FamilyAndCareer",

Neither waited for the “right” moment.\n\nThey just played their game when it mattered.\n\nReminds me why I sometimes make my best calls at work when I stop overthinking and just go with what feels right.\n\nSome of our biggest wins have come from trusting ourselves rather than waiting for perfect data.\n\nAnyway, hell of a match.

          "content": "A German psychologist spent years memorizing nonsense syllables.\n\n\nHis self-experiment in 1885 revealed something shocking about human memory.\n\nThe results explain why most training programs fail - and how to fix them:\n\nThe experiment: Hermann Ebbinghaus tested his own memory using meaningless combinations of letters.\n\nHe memorized lists, then tested himself at different intervals. What he discovered changed our understanding of learning forever. \n\nThe brutal truth: Within an hour of learning new information people tend to forget up to 50% of it. Within 24 hours, this can increase to 70% .\n\nWithin a week, they forget up to 90% of what they \"learned\". Your brain literally dumps most new information within hours.\n\nWhy this happens: Your brain is constantly filtering what's \"worth keeping.\"\n\nUnless information gets reinforced, it assumes it's not important.\n\nThe sharpest decline in retention occurs within the first twenty minutes and is significant within the first hour.\n\nHere's the simple technique that changes everything:\n\nSpaced repetition.\nInstead of cramming once, you review at strategic intervals:\n- Review #1: Within 24 hours\n- Review #2: After 3 days\n- Review #3: After 1 week\n- Review #4: After 1 month\nInstead of trying to cram all the information in at once, repeat the learning multiple times after the initial lesson. This strategy helps to increase memory retention.\n\nEach review \"resets\" the forgetting curve, making memories stronger and longer-lasting.\n\nWhy most training fails: Companies spend millions on one-time workshops, then wonder why nothing sticks.\n\nEmployees forget 90% within a week because there's no follow-up.\n\nHow I apply this: \n→ Set calendar reminders to review key concepts 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week after learning \n→ Use spaced repetition apps like Anki for important information\n→ Break training into smaller chunks with built-in review cycles \n→ Take notes, then revisit them at increasing intervals\n\nThe difference between forgetting and mastering isn't talent. It's timing.\n\nWhat's one skill you learned but lost because you didn't review it?",
