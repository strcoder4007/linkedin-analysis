That’s breakfast in Dubai, meetings in Nairobi, and dinner in Mumbai.\n\n> You don't have to pay income tax, capital gains tax, or inheritance tax.\n\n> Top-tier infrastructure: 2 world class airports + Jebel Ali Port\n\n> Zero red tape: duty-free zones, 100% foreign ownership in many sectors\n\n> Massive talent pool: cross-border hiring made easy\n\n> Access to 3 billion+ consumers across emerging and mature markets\n\nEntering Dubai is not entering only one market; it's stepping into a region. Dubai not only gives people ease of doing business but also speed.\n\nNo wonder companies set up here to scale faster: logistics are tighter, regulations are cleaner, and your markets are literally hours away.\n\nAnd once you see it that way, it's hard to unsee.\n\nDo you run a business in Dubai?\n\n\nhashtag\n#Dubai \nhashtag\n#business \nhashtag\n#uae",
