But we miss asking, \"85% accurate at what? Predicting the past or predicting your future?\"\n\nMost AI demos follow the same script. Show impressive accuracy numbers. Promise efficiency gains. Present quick timelines. But it rarely shows how these claims were tested.\n\nHere's what I've learned about testing AI:\n\nBusiness Metrics are important. \"Hours saved\", \"FTE re-calibration\", \"costs saved\", \"revenue increase\". Also, define the decision and the cost of being wrong (false positives vs false negatives)\n\nEqually important question: Is your AI making the right decisions when it matters? And how do you know?\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁, check what's missing. Seasonal changes, competitor actions, market shifts, local events (Ramadan/Diwali), VAT or policy changes, promotions. Run data-leakage checks to avoid biased attribution.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱, test the method, not just the math. Validate problem framing, target definition, feature engineering and constraints. The smartest algorithm is useless if it's solving the wrong problem.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗱, test on real-world, out-of-time data. If your AI only works on training data, it's not intelligence-it's memorization. Use holdout tests and rolling back tests. And optimize expected value, not generic accuracy.\n\n𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘁𝗵, test different scenarios. What works in \nhashtag\n#Dubai might fail in London. What works in Q1 might break in Q4. Include shocks (supply disruptions), demand spikes (holiday seasons), and channel shifts.\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗳𝘁𝗵, establish governance & human-in-the-loop. Define approval points, model explanations, and escalation paths for high-risk decisions.\n\n𝗦𝗶𝘅𝘁𝗵, monitor constantly. Watch for data changes and business shifts. Retrain regularly and document updates as conditions change to minimise data and concept drifts.\n\nThe Russian saying 'Trust, but verify' was made famous by President Reagan. In the AI age, this isn't just good advice. It's survival.\n\nEvery algorithm will touch your revenue, reputation, and competitive position for years. As we are RTD AI models, you could ask validation questions like these:\n\nFor marketing attribution: Show me how this model performed when we paused Google Ads for a month.\n\nFor sales forecasting: What happens to accuracy when we remove our top-performing rep's data?\n\nFor pricing algorithms: How does this model handle flash sales vs. regular discount periods?\n\nFor investment recommendations: What's our override protocol when the model suggests 20% below market rate?\n\nFor customer churn prediction: Show me the false positive rate—how many 'loyal' customers did we unnecessarily discount?\n\nPreparing \nhashtag\n#AI for \nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation? - Trust by Authority → Trust by Process → Trust by Verification.",

Three models:\n• Promo propensity - predicting purchase likelihood\n• Promo uplift - ROI between promotion vs. no-promotion \n• Content propensity and effectiveness – eliminate non-performing content\n\nThe Activation Layer (Scale After Foundation):\nPicture this: within an hour of promotion approval, can your system launch personalized mortgage campaigns across property portals, broker networks, and prospect touchpoints?\n\n𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 must connect upstream data with downstream execution.\n• Workflow Orchestration manages offers and AI content across campaigns\n• Integrated Order Management Systems (catalogue, tag, distribute, redeem) delivering automation at enterprise scale\n\nBut models and creatives without distribution are just expensive spreadsheets.\n𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 must process signals instantly, enabling real-time personalization\n• Customer signal processing through journey orchestration and optimizing messaging\n• Integration across multivendor advertising systems for a consistent brand experience\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 closes the loop through centralized reporting - executives track revenue impact while operators optimize campaigns. \n\nThe sequence matters more than the technology. \n\nBuild your data foundation first. Get your decision engines humming. Layer on creative systems and distribution networks only after the foundation is solid. Skip steps, and you'll join the 65-70% still waiting for ROI.\n\n\nhashtag\n#AgenticAI \nhashtag\n#AIUAE \nhashtag\n#GenAI \nhashtag\n#CustomerExperience \nhashtag\n#DigitalTransformation \nhashtag\n#Ecom \nhashtag\n#RealEstate",

          "content": "When we talk about AI or LLMs, it often sounds like one giant category. But not all models are built the same and more importantly, not all are meant to solve the same problems.\n\nThe future of AI is not just about bigger models, but about choosing the right type of model for the right context.\n\nHere is one way to classify LLMs:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Generalist LLMs\n\nBroad, versatile models trained on massive datasets across domains. They are designed to handle almost anything: from drafting content to coding assistance, brainstorming, or customer support.\n\nExamples: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Meta LLaMA.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Specialist LLMs\n\nFine-tuned for accuracy in a particular industry or vertical. These models understand compliance, jargon, and domain-specific challenges far better than generalists.\n\nExamples: BloombergGPT (finance), Med-PaLM (healthcare)\n\n⸻\n\n3. Lightweight / Edge LLMs\n\nSmaller and faster models optimized for efficiency. They are built for devices with limited compute, lower costs, or stricter privacy requirements—bringing AI closer to the edge.\n\nExamples: Mistral 7B, LLaMA-2-7B, Phi-3, Google Gemma.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Reasoning LLMs\n\nThe new wave of models designed for structured, step-by-step logical reasoning. Instead of just predicting text, they “think” through problems making them better at planning, problem solving, and decision support.\n\nExamples: DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1 models, K2 Think.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Agentic LLMs\n\nThe most advanced category—these don’t just respond, they act. By connecting to APIs, triggering workflows, and executing tasks autonomously, they behave like digital co-workers.\n\nExamples: OpenAI GPTs (custom agents), AutoGPT, LangChain-powered agents.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe real question is no longer “Which LLM is best?”\nIt is: “Which type of LLM is best for the problem I am solving?”\n\nA mobile-first app may need a Lightweight model.\nAn innovation lab may explore Reasoning or Agentic LLMs to unlock new possibilities.\n\n⸻\n\nThe takeaway:\n\nWe are moving from a world of “one-size-fits-all” AI to a future where LLMs are clustered, specialized, and chosen strategically.\n\nIf you had to pick one - would you start with a Generalist for broad coverage, or a Specialist for deep accuracy?\n\n\nhashtag\n#AI \nhashtag\n#LLM \nhashtag\n#Innovation \nhashtag\n#DataStrategy \nhashtag\n#Leadership",

From drafting reports to analyzing data, these tools offer instant productivity gains, but when used outside official channels, they create what we call Shadow AI.\n\nThe Risks:\n\n1. Sensitive data exposed to unapproved platforms\n2. Lack of oversight and accountability\n3. Outputs inconsistent with business standards\n4. Compliance and regulatory violations\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nShadow AI is proof of demand: people want AI to make work faster, smarter, and easier. Instead of blocking it, leaders should channel it.\n\nThe Path Forward:-\n1. Provide company-approved AI platforms\n2. Establish clear governance and usage policies\n3. Educate teams on responsible adoption\n4. Monitor usage to align AI with strategic goals\n\nShadow AI is not a threat it’s a signal. A signal that your workforce is ready to embrace AI today. The question is: Will organisations lead that adoption responsibly, or play catch up?",

Families drew what they needed, and the balance was kept. Until a few traders thought: “If I take just a little more, I’ll profit faster.” Soon everyone followed, and the well ran dry.\n\nThat’s the Tragedy of the Commons.\n\nModern UAE Business Parallels\n\n🔹 Real Estate Brokers in Business Bay\n\n One broker thinks: “If I message every investor 10 times a day, I’ll close faster.” Soon, every broker floods inboxes and WhatsApp. Investors stop picking calls altogether. The whole industry’s credibility suffers.\n\n🔹 Mall Tenants\n\n A retail shop in Deira Mall cranks up its music to pull customers. Others do the same. Soon, the mall feels like chaos—customers walk out. Everyone loses business.\n\n🔹 Logistics & Warehousing\n\n A few operators overbook loading bays “just in case.” Trucks pile up, delays grow, and the shared infrastructure collapses. Instead of faster service, everyone faces angry clients.\n\n🔹 Tourism & Hospitality\n\n One desert safari operator cuts costs by overusing fragile dunes. Others copy. Tourists find eroded, crowded landscapes, and Dubai loses a unique attraction.\n\n🔹 Corporate Trust\n\nA businessman inflates short-term profits, thinking, “No one will notice.” But if every company does the same, investors lose faith in the whole market.\nThe Lesson for UAE Entrepreneurs\n\nDubai thrives because it balances individual ambition with shared prosperity. \n\nThe commons today is not a well or a pasture—it’s:\n- Investor trust in Dubai as a safe, profitable market\n- Shared infrastructure like freezones, roads, and ports\n- The reputation of our industries\n\nBusinessmen who protect the commons—by being ethical, professional, and sustainable—win in the long run. Those who exploit it may gain a quick dirham, but they risk drying out the well for everyone.\n\nThe real winners are those who think beyond their own bucket, and ensure the well remains full for tomorrow.",

This year I didn’t even have to travel far as the event is being held in the same location as our office. The first panel included an interesting discussion on luxury real estate. The one big takeaway this morning in Dubai’s luxury real estate is that wellness and smart living aren’t add-ons anymore, they are key essentials . \n\nI learnt a new term this morning which was ‘ROL’. No , not rolling on the floor laughing 🤣 but “return on lifestyle”! It’s not just about luxury finishes, it’s about how a home supports a lifestyle.\n\nDubai is moving fast in setting the standard for what luxury living means globally, and it’s exciting to see developers, designers, and innovators pushing this vision forward.\n\nFor those in the industry , do you think wellness and smart homes will soon be the baseline for luxury real estate everywhere?\n\n\nhashtag\n#DubaiRealEstate \nhashtag\n#LuxuryRealEstate \nhashtag\n#SmartHomes \nhashtag\n#WellnessLiving \nhashtag\n#BiophilicDesign",

The truth is simple – Etihad Rail is going to be a big value driver.\n\nAreas like Dubai South, Al Furjan, JVC, DLRC, IMPZ, Business Bay, and Dubai Creek Harbour will all feel the impact. We’re talking better connectivity, stronger price growth, and more rental demand.\n\nFor homeowners, it’s a chance at better resale value (depending on the project, location, and quality). For investors, it’s about getting in early on communities along the rail corridor before prices really move.\n\n(Below Image from below https://lnkd.in/d4dznuCX)\n\nhashtag\n#Dubai \nhashtag\n#RealEstate \nhashtag\n#Advisory \nhashtag\n#EtihadRail \nhashtag\n#Investor",

          "content": "Foundations in Dubai are a unique legal structure, primarily used by wealthy individuals and families to manage and protect both personal and business assets. Real estate ownership through a corporate entity offers several important benefits over purchasing as an individual, particularly in terms of financial efficiency, legal protection, and long-term stability.\n\nRecently, I advised a client in Dubai and who is a US citizen, while his siblings hold different nationalities. This made inheritance and succession planning a complex challenge for the family, particularly for their children.\n\nAfter reviewing various structures and consulting with advisors, the DIFC Foundation (recognized by the Dubai Land Department for real estate ownership) stood out as the most suitable solution. It provided clarity, governance, and a framework to ensure a smooth transition of wealth across generations. The client is now preparing to establish this foundation.\n\nWe are seeing more clients exploring corporate vehicles like foundations. For international investors in particular, the appeal is clear: security, confidentiality, and structured succession planning.",

Palm Jebel Ali has 3 entry and exit points, whereas Palm Jumeirah only has 1, leading to better traffic flow\n\n3. Water circulation on Palm Jebel Ali is better due to multiple openings along the crescent, ensuring better water flow and clarity of water\n\n4. Villas on Palm Jebel Ali have a facelift and look more modern, with sustainability at the forefront. Whereas Palm Jumeirah villas are outdated.\n\n5. Price/sqft on Palm Jebel Ali is 3x less than on Palm Jumeirah, giving you a higher scope for capital appreciation \n\nMessage me now to submit your EOI 📥 \n\n\nhashtag\n#palmjebelali \nhashtag\n#palmjumeirah \nhashtag\n#dubai \nhashtag\n#realestate \nhashtag\n#dubairealestate \nhashtag\n#sustainability",
